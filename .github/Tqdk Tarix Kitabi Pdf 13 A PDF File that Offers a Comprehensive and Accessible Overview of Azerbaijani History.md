The history of Azerbaijan is rich and diverse, reflecting its strategic location at the crossroads of different civilizations and cultures. The country has witnessed many invasions, migrations, and influences from various empires and peoples, such as the Persians, Turks, Mongols, Russians, and Soviets. The country has also developed its own distinctive identity and traditions, based on its ancient heritage, Islamic faith, Turkic language, and Caucasian ethnicity.
 
One of the most important and controversial episodes in the history of Azerbaijan is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which erupted in the late 1980s between Azerbaijan and Armenia over a disputed territory populated mostly by ethnic Armenians but located within Azerbaijan. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war after the collapse of the Soviet Union, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties and hundreds of thousands of refugees on both sides. A ceasefire was signed in 1994, but the status of Nagorno-Karabakh remained unresolved and sporadic clashes continued along the line of contact. In 2020, a new war broke out between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which ended with a Russian-brokered peace deal that restored most of Azerbaijan's control over Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas.
