# How to Crack Winsoft Barcode 4.0 and Generate Barcodes in Delphi
 
Winsoft Barcode 4.0 is a component for Delphi and C++ Builder that allows you to create and scan barcodes of various types and formats. It uses Zint Barcode Generator, a library that supports over 50 symbologies, including Code 128, Data Matrix, QR Code, PDF417, Aztec, and more. Winsoft Barcode 4.0 is compatible with Windows 32 and Windows 64, and it comes with source code and royalty-free distribution in applications.
 
However, Winsoft Barcode 4.0 is not a free component. You need to purchase a license for one developer or for all developers in your company. The price ranges from $80 USD to $240 USD, depending on the number of licenses you need. Moreover, you need to pay for yearly upgrades if you want to get the latest version of the component.

If you don't want to spend money on Winsoft Barcode 4.0, you might be tempted to look for a cracked version of the component online. There are some websites that claim to offer Winsoft Barcode 4.0 cracked, but they are not reliable or safe. They might contain malware, viruses, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. They might also not work properly or have limited functionality.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend downloading or using Winsoft Barcode 4.0 cracked from any source. Instead, we suggest you try the trial version of the component first and see if it meets your needs and expectations. You can download the trial version from the official website of Winsoft[^1^]. The trial version has some limitations, such as a watermark on the generated barcodes and a nag screen on startup, but it allows you to test the component's features and performance.
 
If you are satisfied with the trial version of Winsoft Barcode 4.0, you can purchase a license from the same website[^2^]. You will receive a registration code that will unlock the full functionality of the component and remove the limitations of the trial version. You will also get access to technical support and updates for one year.
 
However, if you still want to crack Winsoft Barcode 4.0 and use it without paying for a license, you will need some skills and tools to do so. You will need a debugger, a disassembler, a hex editor, and a patcher. You will also need to understand assembly language and reverse engineering techniques. You will have to analyze the executable file of Winsoft Barcode 4.0 and find the code that checks for the registration code and validates it. You will then have to modify or bypass that code so that it always returns true regardless of the input.
 
This is not an easy task and it might take you a lot of time and effort to accomplish it. Moreover, it is illegal and unethical to crack Winsoft Barcode 4.0 or any other software without the permission of the author or owner. You might face legal consequences or penalties if you are caught doing so.
 
Therefore, we advise you not to crack Winsoft Barcode 4.0 or any other software without authorization. Instead, we encourage you to support the developers who create useful and quality software by purchasing their products legally.
