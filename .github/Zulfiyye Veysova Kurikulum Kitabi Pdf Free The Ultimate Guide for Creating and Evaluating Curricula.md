One of the main features of Zulfiyye Veysova Kurikulum Kitabi is that it introduces and applies the interactive teaching method, which is a way of instructing that involves active participation of students and teachers in the learning process[^1^]. Interactive teaching methods use dialogue, audio-visuals, hands-on demonstrations, and group tasks to stimulate motivation, independence, critical thinking, and communication skills[^1^] [^2^]. They differ from traditional methods that are oriented on the teacher and passive reception of information by the students[^1^].
 
Interactive teaching methods can be applied to various subjects and levels of education[^1^] [^2^]. They can also improve learning outcomes and student satisfaction, as well as reduce achievement gaps among different groups of students[^2^] [^3^]. Interactive teaching methods require careful planning and execution by the teacher, as well as clear explanation of the goals and benefits of each activity to the students[^2^]. Interactive teaching methods can also be adapted to different contexts and situations, depending on the needs and preferences of the learners and the teacher.
