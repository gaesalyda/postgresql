The album was recorded at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California on August 12 and 14, 1975. It was produced by Dale Oehler, who also arranged most of the tracks. The personnel included Oscar Brashear and Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Plas Johnson on flute, Ernie Watts and Fred Jackson Jr. on tenor saxophone and flute, Eddie Cano on piano, Larry Nash on electric piano, Dennis Budimir on guitar, Chuck Domanico and Dave Troncoso on bass, Harvey Mason on drums, and a percussion section composed of Bobby Matos, Johnny Paloma, Victor Pantoja, Ralph MacDonald, Willie Bobo, and Rudy Calzado[^1^] [^2^].
  
The album consists of eight tracks, seven of which are originals by Hutcherson or his collaborators. The only cover is "Oye Como Va", a classic by Tito Puente that became a hit for Santana in 1970. Hutcherson gives it a fresh and funky twist, with a prominent electric piano riff and a lively horn section. The title track, "Montara", is a beautiful ballad that features Hutcherson's lyrical vibraphone solo over a gentle Latin groove. The opening track, "Camel Rise", is a funky fusion piece that showcases the tight interplay between the horns and the rhythm section. "La Malanga (Se Acabo)" is a catchy and upbeat song that features vocals by Rudy Calzado, who also wrote the lyrics. "Love Song" is a romantic and soulful tune that features Blue Mitchell's warm trumpet solo and Plas Johnson's smooth soprano saxophone solo. "Little Angel" is a sweet and tender song that features Hutcherson's marimba playing over a soft background of strings and flutes. "Yuyo" is a fast and energetic song that displays Hutcherson's virtuosity on the vibes and marimba, as well as the percussionists' skills.
