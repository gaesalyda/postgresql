Click on the "Enter Serial Number" button at the bottom right corner and enter the serial number you got from the website. Click on "Activate" and wait for a few seconds until you see a message saying "Activation Successful".
 
## Step 2: Enable system protection and choose a protection mode
 
Now that you have activated the full version of Wondershare Time Freeze, you can enable system protection by clicking on the "ON/OFF" button at the top left corner. You will see a green check mark indicating that system protection is on.
 
You can also choose between two protection modes: physical memory buffer mode or normal mode. Physical memory buffer mode uses your RAM to create a virtual system, which is faster and more efficient than normal mode, but it requires more memory space. Normal mode uses your hard disk space to create a virtual system, which is slower but more stable than physical memory buffer mode.
 
To choose a protection mode, click on the "Settings" button at the top right corner and go to the "System Protection" tab. You will see a window like this:

Select either "Physical Memory Buffer Mode" or "Normal Mode" and click on "OK". You may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
 
## Step 3: Enter the virtual system and try out any changes you want
 
Once you have enabled system protection and chosen a protection mode, you can enter the virtual system by clicking on the "Enter Virtual System" button at the bottom left corner. You will see a message saying "Entering Virtual System..." and then your computer will reboot into the virtual system.
 
In the virtual system, you can try out any changes you want to apply to your PC, such as installing new software, changing settings, browsing websites, etc. None of these changes will affect your real system, so you don't have to worry about any harm or damage.
 
## Step 4: Save or discard the changes to the virtual system
 
After you have finished trying out any changes in the virtual system, you can choose to save or discard them by clicking on the "Exit Virtual System" button at the bottom left corner. You will see a window like this:
