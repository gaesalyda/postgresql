In this article, we will give you an overview of the main features and functions of X Pert Highscore Plus and how to use them effectively. We will also provide some tips and tricks to optimize your XRD results and avoid common pitfalls.
  
## Phase Identification
 
One of the most common applications of XRD is to identify the phases present in a sample based on their characteristic diffraction patterns. X Pert Highscore Plus has a powerful search-match algorithm that combines peak and net profile data in a single search step, which usually produces the most reliable results. You can also use peak or profile data individually or re-score the existing candidates list based on your preference.
 
X Pert Highscore Plus supports various databases of reference patterns, such as the ICDD PDF-4+, the COD, and the CSD. You can also create your own user databases or import external data sources. You can customize the search criteria and filters to narrow down the possible matches and rank them according to different scores. You can also view the quality indicators and residual plots to evaluate the fit between the experimental and reference patterns.

## Crystallographic Analysis
 
If you want to determine the crystal structure of a phase in your sample, you can use X Pert Highscore Plus to perform indexing, unit cell refinement, space group determination, and structure solution. X Pert Highscore Plus contains four classical indexing routines (Ito, Dicvol, Treor, or McMaille) plus a random-search/grid-search routine. The unit cell refinement and a space group test can be performed on either the full profile (Le Bail fit) or on indexed peaks. You can also perform a Pawley fit to refine lattice parameters.
 
X Pert Highscore Plus can also solve crystal structures from powder data using direct methods or simulated annealing. You can import structure data from various formats, such as CIF, SHELX, or MOL files. You can also edit the structure parameters manually or using graphical tools. You can visualize the structure in 3D and export it to other software for further analysis.
  
## Cluster Analysis
 
If you have a large amount of XRD data from different samples or experiments, you can use cluster analysis to sort them into closely related groups based on their similarity. Cluster analysis can help you find patterns and trends in your data, identify outliers and anomalies, and compare different conditions or treatments. Cluster analysis is useful for non-ambient experiments, mining samples and soil mapping, synthesis experiments such as zeolites, and finding polymorphs and solvates in drug development.
 
X Pert Highscore Plus can perform cluster analysis using different methods, such as hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares regression (PLSR), or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). You can choose the input data (peak positions, intensities, profiles, etc.), the distance measure (Euclidean, Pearson correlation, etc.), and the clustering algorithm (Ward's method, k-means, etc.). You can also adjust the number of clusters and the threshold for outliers. You can visualize the results in various plots, such as dendrograms, scatter plots, biplots, or score plots.
  
## Rietveld Refinement
 
If you want to obtain quantitative information about the phases in your sample, such as their relative amounts, lattice parameters, atomic positions, microstructural parameters, etc., you can use Rietveld refinement to fit a model of your sample to the experimental data. Rietveld refinement can also improve the quality of your data by correcting for instrumental effects, such as background subtraction, peak shape correction, preferred orientation correction, etc.
 
X Pert Highscore Plus can perform Rietveld refinement of powder or neutron data using different profile functions that fit to all optics of common diffraction instruments. You can refine various parameters of your model using different strategies and constraints. You can also use automatic batches and scripts to simplify your workflow
