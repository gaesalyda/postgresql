In this article, we will show you some examples of how Amped FIVE can help you enhance and analyze your forensic image and video evidence. We will use some real cases that were solved with the help of Amped FIVE, and show you the steps and tools that were used to achieve the best results.
 
## Case 1: Identifying a suspect from a CCTV video
 
In this case, a robbery occurred at a convenience store, and the only evidence available was a low-quality CCTV video that captured the suspect entering and leaving the store. The video was dark, blurry, and noisy, and the suspect's face was barely visible. The investigators needed to enhance the video and extract a clear image of the suspect's face to identify him and link him to the crime.
 
The first step was to import the video into Amped FIVE and correct some common issues such as interlacing and aspect ratio. Then, the investigators used the Crop filter to isolate the frames where the suspect's face was most visible. Next, they used the Average Frames filter to combine multiple frames into one image, reducing noise and increasing resolution. Then, they used the Levels filter to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image, making the face more visible. Finally, they used the Unsharp Mask filter to sharpen the image and enhance the details.
 
The result was a much clearer image of the suspect's face, which could be used for identification purposes. The investigators were able to compare the image with a database of mugshots and find a match. The suspect was arrested and confessed to the robbery.
 
## Case 2: Measuring the height of a hit-and-run driver from a dashcam video
 
In this case, a pedestrian was hit by a car that fled the scene. The only evidence available was a dashcam video from another car that witnessed the incident. The video showed the driver getting out of his car briefly before driving away. The investigators needed to measure the height of the driver from the video to narrow down the list of possible suspects.
 
The first step was to import the video into Amped FIVE and select a frame where the driver was standing next to his car. Then, they used the Perspective Correction filter to correct the distortion caused by the camera angle and align the image with a horizontal plane. Next, they used the Measurement filter to set a reference object with a known size (the license plate of the car) and measure its pixel dimensions. Then, they used the same filter to measure the pixel height of the driver. Finally, they used a simple formula to convert pixels into centimeters: (driver height in pixels / license plate height in pixels) x license plate height in centimeters.
 
The result was an estimate of the driver's height in centimeters, which could be used as a criterion for filtering potential suspects. The investigators were able to compare this information with other clues such as vehicle model, color, and registration number, and narrow down their search. The driver was eventually identified and arrested.
 
## Case 3: Recovering text from a burned document
 
In this case, a fire broke out at an office building where some important documents were stored. The fire was suspected to be arson, and some of the documents were partially burned and illegible. The investigators needed to recover as much text as possible from the documents to find out if they contained any relevant information for the case.
 
The first step was to scan or photograph the documents and import them into Amped FIVE. Then, they used
