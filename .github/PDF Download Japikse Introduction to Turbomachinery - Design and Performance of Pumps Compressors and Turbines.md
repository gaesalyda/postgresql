The book is based on many years of teaching, research, and consulting experience of the authors, who are experts in the field of turbomachinery. The book aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the subject for final-year undergraduates or new graduates beginning a study of turbomachinery, as well as a refresher and reference text for established practitioners.
 
The book is divided into 13 chapters, covering topics such as essentials of turbomachinery performance and durability, centrifugal compressors and pumps, axial compressors and fans, radial inflow turbines, axial flow turbines, mixed flow machines, boundary layer and computational techniques for flow prediction, stability limits of turbomachinery, structural and modal analysis of blades and rotors, test bed, laboratory, and workshop procedures for turbomachinery development, instrumentation issues for turbomachinery testing and monitoring, and case studies of turbomachinery failures.
 
The book is fully illustrated with diagrams, graphs, tables, and photographs to aid understanding. The book also includes experimental data and empirical correlations to support the theoretical concepts. The book also features exercises and problems at the end of each chapter to test the reader's knowledge and understanding.
 
Introduction to Turbomachinery is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the design and performance of turbomachinery. The book can be found in various online platforms such as Google Books[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], where you can preview some of the pages or purchase a copy.
