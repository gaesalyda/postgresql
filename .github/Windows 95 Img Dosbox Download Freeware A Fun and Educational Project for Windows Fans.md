## Tips and Tricks

- To exit Windows 95 and return to DOSBox-X, press Ctrl+F9.
- To exit DOSBox-X and close the emulator, type "exit" (without quotes) and press Enter.
- To change the screen resolution or color depth of Windows 95, right-click on the desktop, select Properties, select Settings, and adjust the options as desired.
- To enable sound support in Windows 95, you need to install a sound driver. You can download one from [here](https://www.philscomputerlab.com/sound-blaster-16-drivers.html). Follow the instructions on how to install it on Windows 95.
- To enable CD-ROM support in Windows 95, you need to edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in the disk image file. You can do this by opening WinImage, opening the disk image file, right-clicking on AUTOEXEC.BAT, selecting Extract, editing it with a text editor, saving it, and dragging it back into WinImage.
