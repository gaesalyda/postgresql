Neuroimmunology is a field that studies the interaction of the immune and nervous systems[^4^]. It aims to better understand the mechanisms and consequences of inflammation and autoimmunity in various neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, neurosarcoidosis, and paraneoplastic syndromes[^5^]. Neuroimmunology also explores how immune molecules, such as cytokines and chemokines, modulate brain function in health and disease[^4^].
